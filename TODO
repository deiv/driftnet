TODO for driftnet

* More intelligent layout algorithm for images.

* Memory leaks? Buffer overruns? Static-sized buffers.

* Parse JPEG files properly -- the lame memstr(..., "\xff\xd9") thing is
  broken and should be done right. At the moment, some JPEG files get
  truncated in a really bad way. An alternative is to store more state for
  JPEG files, and do special parsing when we know a connection has closed.

* Problem with some greyscale JPEG files.

* More portability / bug fixes.

* `Bogus image' problem after running for a while?
